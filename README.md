# Haiku Generator

This neural net uses transformer to generate Haikus character by character. Does a good job at generating Haiku like words and learning the structure (not all of them looks like English though :D). 

Only trained this for a few minutes on my Macbook Air (m2). This is for my own learning purposes, credit goes to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY (Andrej Karpathy)

`haiku.word.transformer.ipynb` handles word level haiku generation.

# Samples:
## After training just for one epoch, it generates totally incomprehensible gibberish:
```

```

## After training for 200 epochs, it's almost English like:
```
